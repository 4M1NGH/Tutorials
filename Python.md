Notes
===
- Python is case-sensetive
- Spaces has meaning in Python.  This is the Pythonic way of brining structure to code
- Pythonic way of naming variables: snake_case
- ```type```(3.14) to check data type
- ```print```("Hello") to print to screen

Data Types
===
- ```flaot```: 3.14, 3.
- ```int```: 3
- ```string```: "3.14"
- ```bool```: True, False

Data Structures
===
Collection of group of data types
- ```list```
- ```tuple```
- ```set```
- ```dictionary```
- ```compound```


Number Operations
===
- ```^``` is the bitwise operator not the power operator which is ```**```
- ```//``` for integer division which round-down
  - ```7//2 = 3``` and ```-7//2 = -4``` 
- e for scientific operation ```3e4 = 30,000```
- ```int(3.14)``` to convert to integer ```3```
- ```float(3)``` to convert to float ```3.0```
- ```methods``` are associated with different types of objects while ```functions``` are generic

String Operations
===
- "Hi" + "there" = "Hithere"
- "Hi" * 2 = "HiHi"
- ```str(3.14)``` to convert to string
- ```len("Hi") = 2```

String Methods
===
- "amin alashim".```title()``` = Amin Alhashim
- ```islower()```, ```count('a')```
- "Ali like {}".```formate```("Mohammad") = "Ali like Mohammad"
- "This is a nice code".```split```() = "This", "is", "a", "nice", "code"
- "This is a nice code".```split```(' ', 3) = "This", "is", "a", "nice code"
- "This is a nice code".```split```(None, 3) = "This", "is", "a", "nice code"
